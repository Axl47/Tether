## Task Completion Requirements

- `vp check` and `vp run typecheck` must pass before considering tasks completed on the upstream pnpm/vp base.
  - If changing native mobile code, `vp run lint:mobile` must also pass.
- Use `vp test` for the built-in Vite+ test command and `vp run test` when you specifically need the `test` package script.
- NEVER run `bun test` in this repository lineage. If using Bun in a compatibility context, use `bun run test` so Vitest receives the package script environment.

## ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan as described in `.docs/PLANS.md`. Write new plans to `.docs/exec/`. Keep the plan current as work proceeds so another engineer can resume from the document alone.

## Rule

Always prefix shell commands with `rtk`.

Examples:

```bash
rtk git status
rtk cargo test
rtk pnpm build
rtk vp run typecheck
rtk proxy <cmd>     # Run raw command without filtering
```

## RTK Verification

```bash
rtk --version
rtk gain
which rtk
```

## Project Snapshot

Tether is a minimal web GUI for using coding agents like Codex and Claude Code.

This repository is a VERY EARLY WIP. Proposing sweeping changes that improve long-term maintainability is encouraged.

## Core Priorities

1. Performance first.
2. Reliability first.
3. Keep behavior predictable under load and during failures (session restarts, reconnects, partial streams).

If a tradeoff is required, choose correctness and robustness over short-term convenience.

## Maintainability

Long term maintainability is a core priority. If you add new functionality, first check if there is shared logic that can be extracted to a separate module. Duplicate logic across multiple files is a code smell and should be avoided. Don't be afraid to change existing code. Don't take shortcuts by just adding local logic to solve a problem.

## Package Roles

- `apps/server`: Node.js WebSocket server. Wraps Codex app-server (JSON-RPC over stdio), serves the React web app, and manages provider sessions.
- `apps/web`: React/Vite UI. Owns session UX, conversation/event rendering, and client-side state. Connects to the server via WebSocket.
- `packages/contracts`: Shared effect/Schema schemas and TypeScript contracts for provider events, WebSocket protocol, and model/session types. Keep this package schema-only — no runtime logic.
- `packages/shared`: Shared runtime utilities consumed by both server and client applications. Uses explicit subpath exports (e.g. `@t3tools/shared/git`) — no barrel index.
- `packages/client-runtime`: Shared runtime package for sharing client code across web and mobile.

## Codex App Server (Important)

Tether is currently Codex-first. The server starts `codex app-server` (JSON-RPC over stdio) per provider session, then streams structured events to the browser through WebSocket push messages.

How we use it in this codebase:

- Session startup/resume and turn lifecycle are brokered in the server-side Codex provider runtime.
- Provider dispatch and thread event logging are coordinated by the orchestration runtime.
- WebSocket server routes NativeApi methods between browser clients and server services.
- Web app consumers receive orchestration domain events through WebSocket push messages, including provider runtime activity projected into orchestration events server-side.

- Codex App Server docs: https://developers.openai.com/codex/sdk/#app-server

## Reference Repos

- Open-source Codex repo: https://github.com/openai/codex
- Codex-Monitor (Tauri, feature-complete, strong reference implementation): https://github.com/Dimillian/CodexMonitor

Use these as implementation references when designing protocol handling, UX flows, and operational safeguards.

## Vendored Repositories

This project vendors external repositories under `.repos/` as read-only reference material for coding
agents.

- Prefer examples and patterns from the vendored source code over generated guesses or web search results.
- Do not edit files under `.repos/` unless explicitly asked.
- Do not import from `.repos/`; application code must continue importing from normal package dependencies.
- Manage vendored subtrees with `bun run sync:repos`; use `bun run sync:repos --repo <id>` to sync one
  configured repository.
- When updating a dependency with a configured vendored subtree, sync that subtree in the same change so
  `.repos/` matches the installed dependency version.
- When writing Effect code, read `.repos/effect-smol/LLMS.md` first and inspect `.repos/effect-smol/` for
  examples of idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, and API design.
- When writing relay infrastructure code with Alchemy, inspect `.repos/alchemy-effect/` for examples of
  idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, and API design.

## Final Output

When asking the user to verify implemented changes, output a checklist they can fill to make sure everything works as intended. Describe what they should see, how it should work, and what they need to manually test. The user will then fill in the checklist and provide feedback on any issues they encounter, which can be used to further refine the implementation.

If the user asked for multiple changes and only some were implemented, clearly indicate which ones were completed, which ones were not fully realized, and which ones are still pending.

Include a commit message after each implementation or fix, following the Conventional Commits specification.
